# WellUp - Healthy Lifestyle Management Platform

## One-Line Pitch
Lead a healthier lifestyle, manage your schedule better, and feel better.

## Why It Matters
Many polytechnic students have difficulty maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to irregular schedules, lack of knowledge, and limited time. They struggle with forming good habits related to diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and personal grooming. This affects their physical health, mental wellbeing, and academic performance.

WellUp provides a solution to help students take control of their health and daily routines.
